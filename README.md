### Project Background!
*The Gambling Industry*
- "The gambling industry continues to prove that it's one of the most  vibrant entertainment economies in the world"


World gambling statistics show that around 26% of the population  gamble. That means around 1.6 billion people worldwide gamble and
4.2 billion gambles at least once every year. When it comes to online  gambling and demographic statistics, a UK study concludes that 17% of  the population gamble online, resulting in Â£5.3 billion revenue for the  online market alone. The market size of the sports betting and lottery  sector worldwide consistently increased in the past four years, after a  sharp decline in 2014. In 2019, the sector was valued at 218.49 billion
U.S. dollars, reflecting an increase from the previous year. However,
massive reductions in global operations and decreasing demand in the  sports betting and lottery sector was forecast to drive the industry's  market value by as much as seven percent in 2020.Set to Top $635  Billion-casino marketplace Whatâ€™s immediately apparent is the  astounding value of the casino industry in 2017, with its predicted value  set to reach $635 billion in the coming years. Breaking this stat down
further, itâ€™s worth looking at the two key components in casino
gamingâ€™s growth â€“ that being the United States and United Kingdom.  In the United States, predicted cash revenues are expected to hit
$21.14 billion, while in the UK predicted online gambling revenue  should reach $4 billion. These two figures alone make up what should
be a 5.7% growth of the global gambling market before 2022
The growth related to casino play, in general, is huge, but practically all  of this has occurred in the online domain. Land-based casino play is  still on the downturn â€“ apart from within a few select regions - much  like it has been in recent years. As new online markets open up, we can  only assume that online casino industry will continue to dwarf land-  based operation.

### Secured and Transparent

- Distrust of players toward gambling platforms when playing online  games, is that the player has no way of verifying the randomness of the  method used to determine the winner. Crypto stake addresses this  issue through the use of blockchain and smart contract technology. 
- Our  algorithms for generating random numbers are publicly available and  auditable. The generation of random numbers and distribution of  winnings takes place not on our servers but in a decentralized  blockchain environment. 
- As a result, neither party is permitted to  intervene in this process.

### Road Map
*Crypto Stake is the worldâ€™s largest platform with distributed blockchain  technology for betting on the live sports events, offering the best odds guaranteed.*
